# Documentation Overview
This directory contains all the documentation currently available for this project.

[BuildSystem](BuildSystem.md) contains all information relevant to what happens when you run the make command.

[Layout](Layout.md) explains how the GBL is layed out in RAM.

[Source](Source.md) takes a look into the code and explains what each section is doing in a slightly more in depth view.

[FAT](FAT.md) shows briefly how then FAT filesystem works.

[Scripts](Scripts.md) explains what each script does.

If you're interested in learning how this whole project works I'd recommend reading these files in the following order: BuildSystem > Layout > FAT > Source while looking at the relevant Makefiles/code at the same time.
